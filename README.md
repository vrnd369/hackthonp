# DataAnalyzer Pro Hackathon 2025 (React Version)

This project is now a pure React (TypeScript/TSX) web application. Astro has been completely removed.

## Getting Started

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Project Structure

- `src/components/` — All React components
- `src/layouts/` — Layout components
- `src/lib/` — Utility libraries (Stripe, Supabase, etc.)
- `src/pages/` — Main entry point (see below)

## Main Entry Point

- The main app is now in `src/App.tsx` and bootstrapped from `src/index.tsx`.
